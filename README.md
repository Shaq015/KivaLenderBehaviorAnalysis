# Kiva Lender Behavior Clustering & Classification (R Project)

This project analyzes lender behavior on Kiva, a microfinance platform where people lend to entrepreneurs in underserved areas.

Using clustering and classification techniques in R, we explored what drives lenders to choose specific loans â€” based on attributes like borrower region, age, loan amount, sector, and more.

## Project Goals

- Group lenders into behavioral clusters using **k-means**
- Engineer features such as loan preferences, occupation, and region
- Build a **random forest classifier** to predict lender cluster membership
- Visualize the most important features and patterns per group

## Example Outputs

### Clustering Results
Lenders were grouped into 12 behavioral clusters based on their preferences and activity.
